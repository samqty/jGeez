follow these simple instructions to write new unit tests to jgeez
1)copy the "~template" folder in the same folder "/unittests"
2)rename the folder to the name of the unit test, don't be afraid to make this a long name. The more descriptive the name of the unit test the better.
3)open the folder and rename the "testname.js" file to the name of the unit test
4)open the testhost file and find the script reference "testname.js" and rename it to the unit test
5)open the renamed "testname.js" and type in the unit test javascript and you are done
!!!!!very important!!!!!!!!
make sure the your unit test can run indepedently(hence the whole concept of unit testing :)), it should not depend on elements in the html
if there is a need to use input element make sure to create it using javascript.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6)to run the unit test, open the test host file in any browser

Thanks for your contribution!!!
